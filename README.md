# AI_Projects
All my implementations and AI projects - in a single repository.

The aim of this repository is to develop my theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills of AI models ranging from simple Neural Networks to advanced architectures. 

In order to showcase this, models will be built from scratch in NumPy, with both forward propagation and backpropagation algorithms implemented. For larger models, PyTorch will be used as it works with GPUs and Autodifferentiation will replace explicit backprop algorithms due to computational efficiency.

Thank you for your time and attention.
